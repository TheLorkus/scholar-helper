Supabase scheduling plan:
1. Enable `pg_net` and `pg_cron` extensions so the database can make HTTP requests and run scheduled jobs.
2. Add `call_season_sync()` which posts to the existing `season-sync` function via `net.http_post` using the service role key.
3. Use `cron.schedule` to run `call_season_sync()` hourly; the scheduled-job name is `season-sync-hourly`.
4. After the migrations are pushed, adjust the Supabase Scheduler entry if needed (via SQL or the UI) to trigger at the desired season time.
5. Use `scripts/update_season_schedule.py` to reach into the current season endpoint, compute „season end − 10m“, and call `supabase_scheduler` so the cron expression stays in sync automatically.
6. Consider deploying an Edge Function (`update-season-schedule`) whose sole job is to run daily, compute the new cron, and patch the scheduler by calling the same RPC; schedule this helper from Supabase so the automation runs without a local script.
7. Keep a list of CLI steps for manual operation if automation isn’t available: `supabase functions deploy update-season-schedule`, `supabase scheduling create --name refresh-season-sync-cron --schedule "0 0 * * *" --type function ...`, and rerun `scripts/update_season_schedule.py` or the scheduler function whenever an extra manual update is needed.

Status:
- pg_cron jobs `season-sync-hourly` and `refresh-season-sync-cron` remain active and verified via MCP; they POST to the Edge functions so the hourly season sync and daily scheduler refresh are live.
- Added `scripts/import_season_history.py` plus README guidance to import historical CSVs into `public.season_rewards`, including the new `scholar_payout` column so the Scholar History tab always shows the “paid to scholar” amount.
- Streamlit UI now defaults to the new Brawl Assistant landing page that mirrors the original Splinterlands Brawl Dashboard (history table, per-player drill-down, stats window) and renders wins/losses + win-rate Altair charts driven by the sidebar slider. The Scholar tracker page still derives historical Scholar Payout values from either the imported CSV column or live API and only lets you edit payout currency for the most recent two entries.
